# Fairly
### Fairy is an SaaS platform enabling talent acquisition teams to quickly find the best talent for their company while saving time on recruiting & hiring. Fairly is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains React and .NET code.

My role as a software engineer was to create and implement the functionality of the Organizations and Organization Members to Fairly's database and administrative components. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Create relational database for Organizations and Organization members with Microsoft SQL Server Managemnet Studio

● Created necessary procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination

● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thorooughly tested with Postman

● Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality

● Utilize styling with CSS and Bootstrap

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.

● Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project.

● Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality.

● Participated in daily stand-ups, code review, and code talks with team members to ensure cohesive implementation of code.
